          <h3>Observations between Health Data and Mortality </h3>
          <p>Medical proffessionals are required to analyse vast amounts of data to enable good diagnosis.
            The graph allows the user to interact with numerous data which have been attributed to heart disease and 
            mortality arising from it. 
            What is noted from interacting with this data is that it is impossible to draw any firm conclusions using standard visual or processing
            or regression modelling. 
            This is to say that there may be a corellation between the data and mortality but that human observation cannot 
            find the links. 
            
            </p>
          <br>
          <h3>What other processes could be deployed to make predictions on mortality?</h3>
          <p>Machine Learning is a great tool to use for predictive analytics for "Big Data". The models that can be deployed
            to find links for predictive analytics vary but the objecives remain the same in the analysis of health indicators and mortality associated with heart disease.
            The models we have used are K- Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Random forest, Logistic regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict an outcome of mortality. Each of these models
            Present their own strengths in prediction. By comparing the succes ratio of these models a preffered model can be used.
